        <h2>Missile Man of India</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Indian aeronautical expert Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on October 15, 1931. He studied
          physics and aeronautical engineering and was born and reared in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu.APJ Abdul Kalam worked
          as a scientist and scientific administrator for the following four decades, primarily at the Indian Space
          Research Organisation (ISRO) and the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). Additionally, he
          played a key role in developing India's military missile technology as well as its civilian space programmes.
          Consequently, APJ Abdul Kalam earned the moniker "Missile Man of India" for his contributions to the
          advancement of launch vehicles and ballistic missile technology. With the backing of both the governing
          Bharatiya Janata Party and the then-opposition Indian National Congress, Kalam was chosen as India's 11th
          president in 2002. He served one term as "People's President" before returning to his civilian life of
          teaching, writing, and public service. He had received a number of honours, including the Bharat Ratna, the
          highest civilian award in India.
